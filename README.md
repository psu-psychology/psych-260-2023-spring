# psych-260-2023-spring
Materials for PSYCH 260 taught by Rick Gilmore in the spring of 2023.

This repo contains the code and materials to generate the course syllabus.

We use the `bookdown` package in R to render the site to the `docs/` directory.
Source files are found in `syllabus/`.

To render the site, clone the repository, and then run `bookdown::render_book('syllabus')` from the project's root directory.
